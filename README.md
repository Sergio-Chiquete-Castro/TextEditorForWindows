# TextEditor

This code implements a text editor program in C++ . Here's a rundown of what the code does:

File Management:
Allows users to create new text files and ensures unique file names.
Stores created file names in a separate file named "StoreAllFiles.txt".
Enables users to access existing text files for editing.

Text Editing:
Provides options to edit existing text files, including adding, editing, or deleting lines.
Displays the contents of selected files and allows users to modify them interactively.

User Interface:
Presents a simple command-line interface with clear prompts and instructions.
Utilizes basic terminal commands to clear the screen and provide visual separation between different stages of the program.

Error Handling:
Handles incorrect user inputs by displaying error messages and guiding users back to appropriate actions.

Timer Implementation:
Introduces a timer functionality using the <chrono> and <thread> libraries, though it's primarily used for visual effect 

Similar to a basic text editor, allowing users to create, access, and modify text files through a straightforward command-line interface.


//How to use properly
//first create a file using the interface 
//then you can edit
